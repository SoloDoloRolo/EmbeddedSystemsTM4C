# EmbeddedSystemsTM4C
This is a github for me to present my work for the embedded systems final project that was utilizing the Texas Instrument tm4c123gh6pm alongside some predefined open sourced software.

| State                | Description               |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Home Safe State      | No motion detected.       |
| Left Not Safe State  | Motion detected on left.  |
| Right Not Safe State | Motion detected on right. |

### Improvements Made
- **Real-Time State Handling**: Optimized delays for smoother sensor feedback.
- **Code Modularity**: Refactored to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Hardware Integration**: Added Nokia 5110 LCD for real-time feedback.
